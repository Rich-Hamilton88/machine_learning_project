# machine_learning_project

The objective of this project is to utilize machine learning concepts to try to predict the probable outcome of UFC fights.


## Step 1 - Obtain the data

I first thought about using a UFC dataset on kaggle.com. After further analysis I wanted to obtain the most recent information as possible. I gathered my data from [UFC Stats](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed) website.

## Step 2 - Scrape the website
During our class in week 12 we learned about Web-Scraping. In the span of a week I researched and learned another technique to scrape websites called "Scrapy". This powerful python addon tool is awesome! Try it out to see what your thoughts are.

The link to learn more about Scrapy by going through a tutorial is [here](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html).

Installation instruction are [here](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#intro-install).

By learning the basics of the tool I essentially used Git Bash to write the code to scrape the website of all fighter details including bout information to start my analysis. Utilized Scrapy functions to export scraped data to JSON and CSV files.

## Step 3 - Cleaned CSV files in Jupyter
